PaperStack is a Ruby on Rails web application that helps students get peer-to-peer feedback on an essay. It allows students to comment on other student's essays and give feedback. It also allows for students to upvote or down vote essays, and has a countdown clock to give a sense of peer pressure.

* The front-end was built using Bootstrap. Javascript and  JQuery were also used to improve the User Interface.
 
* The application utilizes the Devise gem for authentication and user management, as well as Carrierwave for document upload and management.
